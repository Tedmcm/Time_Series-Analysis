# Unit 10â€”A Yen for the Future

![Yen Photo](Images/unit-10-readme-photo.png)

## Background

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

In this project, I will test the many time-series tools that I have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

The project is to gain proficiency in the following tasks:

1. Time Series Forecasting
2. Linear Regression Modeling

### Files

I used the following files to get the project stated: 

[Time-Series Starter Notebook](Starter_Code/time_series_analysis.ipynb)

[Linear Regression Starter Notebook](Starter_Code/regression_analysis.ipynb)

[Yen Data CSV File](Starter_Code/yen.csv)

### Instructions

#### Time-Series Forecasting

In this notebook, I will load historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data and apply time series analysis and modeling to determine whether there is any predictable behavior.

I Followed the steps outlined in the time-series starter notebook to complete the following:

1. Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott Filter (Decompose the Settle price into trend and noise).
2. Forecasting Returns using an ARMA Model.
3. Forecasting the Settle Price using an ARIMA Model.
4. Forecasting Volatility with GARCH.

I Also used the results of the time series analysis and modeling to answer the following questions:

1. Based on my time series analysis, would I buy the yen now?
2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
3. Based on the model evaluation, would I feel confident in using these models for trading?


#### Linear Regression Forecasting

In this notebook, I built a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict Yen futures ("settle") returns with *lagged* Yen futures returns and categorical calendar seasonal effects (e.g., day-of-week or week-of-year seasonal effects).

I Followed the steps outlined in the regression_analysis starter notebook to complete the following:

1. Data Preparation (Creating Returns and Lagged Returns and splitting the data into training and testing data)
2. Fitting a Linear Regression Model.
3. Making predictions using the testing data.
4. Out-of-sample performance.
5. In-sample performance.

I used the results of the linear regression analysis and modeling to answer the following question:

* Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?
